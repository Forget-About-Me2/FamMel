# Version 0.5.0 
From this version on the version numbers have been changed to better represent the current state of the game.
This version involves the beginning of an improved game engine, but this is still a work in process. 
This is a major update but mainly for under the hood, the game play has been kept mostly the same with some small additions. 
The game has been given a slightly updated look, though still needs some work.
