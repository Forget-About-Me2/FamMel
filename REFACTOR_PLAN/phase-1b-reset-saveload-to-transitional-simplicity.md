# Phase 1b: Reset Save/Load To Transitional Simplicity

Purpose: remove the over-engineered registry so migration work is easier to reason about.

- [ ] Replace saveLoad.ts field registry/setter graph with a simple transitional approach.
- [ ] Keep behavior identical (save slot, load slot, export/import).
- [ ] Preserve deep-merge behavior for mutable `const` objects (`backPackItems`, `herpurse`).
- [ ] Validate with save/load integration tests.

Exit criteria:
- saveLoad.ts is understandable without tracing 100+ imports.
- Existing save/load tests pass.
