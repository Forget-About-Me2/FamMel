# Phase 4: Final Save/Load Simplification

Implement straightforward gameState serialization.

- [ ] Save snapshot from `gameState` (plus any intentional non-gameState objects).
- [ ] Restore into `gameState` with explicit reconstruction where needed (e.g. `Person` objects if methods/state require rebuilding).
- [ ] Keep file import/export compatibility.

Exit criteria:
- saveLoad.ts is short, explicit, and gameState-centric.
- No knowledge of bridge internals required to maintain save/load.
