# Migration Principles

1. Keep changes mechanical and batch-based.
2. Migrate one owning module at a time.
3. After each batch: build, typecheck, targeted tests for touched areas, and curated userflow smoke tests.
4. Delete old paths immediately after each successful batch (no long-lived dual write paths).
5. No compatibility exceptions: if a slice cannot complete without a compatibility layer, re-scope the slice before execution.
